# C Compiler
This repository contains a C to Mips compiler that I built as coursework in my second year at Imperial College London.
The aim was to build a full compiler from C to Mips using Yacc and Bison to parse and lex the C code.
According to the tests provided by the lecturer under whom I completed this assignment, the Compiler performs as follows:



| Category | Passed | Compiled |  Score |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|
|   direct | 100.0% |   100.0% | 100.0% |
|  integer | 100.0% |   100.0% | 100.0% |
| literals |  62.5% |   100.0% |  73.8% |
|  control |  65.0% |   100.0% |  83.0% |
| function |  83.3% |   100.0% |  88.3% |
|   arrays |  83.3% |   100.0% |  88.3% |
|    float |   0.0% |   100.0% |  42.0% |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|
|  Mean    |        |          |  86.2% |
| Scaled   |        |          |  91.7% |
|  Final   |        |          |  91.7% |
